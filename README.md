## Classic Traveller Speculative Trade Manager

### What is Classic Traveller?

> Traveller (role-playing game)

> Traveller is a tabletop game where characters journey through star systems, engaging in exploration, ground and space battles, and interstellar trading. The game is influenced by various literary works and emphasizes commerce, sociological stratification, and a mix of low and high technology. The setting is centered around the human-dominated Third Imperium, a feudalistic interstellar empire. Despite the focus on humans, the Traveller universe is cosmopolitan and features various other sophont peoples. The game's history also features the Ancients, a highly advanced race that left behind ruins and artifacts scattered throughout the universe.

### What is this PYTHON application for?

Traveller, in all it's forms, was / is somewhat notorious for the amount of administrative burden on the Games Master.  One of the common time sinks was the creation of buy/sell trade good lots for Player Characters to consider as part of Speculative Trade.

This PYTHON-3.18 application is intended to reduce the creation of potential buy/sell trade good lots to running the application in a terminal, and copy-pasting the resulting text output to your preferred game-management tool.

### Sample Output

```text
Speculative Cargo Opportunities
From: sourceworld (C-767795-9  [Ag] [Ri])
To: destworld (B-222699-B  [NAg] [NIn] [P])

Cargo Available: 70 tonnes with a common market value of Cr3000/ton.
   We can purchase them locally for Cr2400.0 per ton, which is a valuation below common market value.
   That will cost us a total of Cr168000.
   This is in part due to our Broker, who will charge us Cr8400.0 for this transaction.
   We expect to be able to sell upon arrival to destworld for Cr5100.0/ton, which would be a total value of Cr357000.
   That would net a *profit* of Cr189000.
```
